# Terminal Rogue

Just a simple text adventure. My first ever program.

The title in-game is shortened to 'TermRogue' to match [PEP-8
recommendations](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

The code is messy because I wrote everything myself, but I did use an AI chatbot
to help me create an early, unfinished version of the Character class - Which
taught me a lot btw.

The methods below were my additions:

- heal
- rebase_def (now removed) 

The armor selection currently does nothing, but I eventually want 3 armor types
with physical, magic, and hybrid defense types. The boss will then either attack
with magic or physical damage.

Yes, that is extremely unbalanced, but it's funny.

More to come.
